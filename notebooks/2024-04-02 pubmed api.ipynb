       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Irisin, a myokine that is responsive to exercise, induces significant changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue. By promoting the browning of white fat tissue, it enhances energy expenditure, thereby addressing overweight and obesity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the effects of different types of physical exercises on irisin levels in overweight and obese adults.<br>METHODS: Specifically, the review focused on studies involving obese or overweight individuals who participated in exercise training for a minimum of 8 weeks, with measured and reported changes in serum irisin levels compared to a control group. Data were collected from four databases (Google Scholar, ISI Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and Scopus). The risk of bias was assessed using the Begg and Egger tests, and the results were synthesized.<br>RESULTS: Initial searches identified 560 titles, out of which only seven met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant increase in serum irisin concentration (SMD = 0.957, <i>P</i> = 0.005) among obese and overweight individuals who engaged in exercise, compared to the passive control group. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) (SMD = 1.229, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) had a more pronounced effect on increasing serum irisin levels than other exercise protocols. Furthermore, the effectiveness of exercise varied based on the participants' weight status (significant changes for overweight individuals; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 and insignificant changes for obese individuals; <i>P</i> = 0.1), age (significant changes for those under 40 years old; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 and insignificant changes for those over 40 years old; <i>P</i> = 0.322), and gender (significant changes for men; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 and insignificant changes for women; <i>P</i> = 0.285).<br>CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, exercise can elevate serum irisin levels, leading to alterations in adipose tissue phenotype and thermogenesis, ultimately contributing to weight reduction in obese and overweight individuals.<br>\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Change of direction (COD) movements are associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in multidirectional sports. Females appear at increased risk compared to males, which could be attributable to whole body kinematic strategies and greater multiplanar knee joint loads (KJLs) during COD which can increase ACL loading.<br>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine and quantitatively synthesise the evidence for differences between males and females regarding KJLs and their biomechanical determinants (whole body kinematic strategies determining KJLs) during COD tasks.<br>METHODS: Databases including SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and PubMed were systematically searched (July 2021-June 2023) for studies that compared differences in knee joint loads and biomechanical determinants of KJLs during COD between males and females. Inclusion criteria were: (1) females and males with no prior history of ACL injury (18-40&#xa0;years); (2) examined biomechanical determinants of KJLs and/ or KJLs during COD tasks&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;20&#xb0;; (3) compared&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1 outcome measure between males and females. Studies published between 2000 and 2023 examining a cutting task&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;20&#xb0; with a preceding approach run that compared KJLs or the whole body multiplanar kinematics associated with them, between sexes, using three-dimensional motion analysis.<br>RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 17 studies with a pooled sample size of 451 participants (227 males, 224 females). Meta-analysis revealed females displayed significantly less peak knee flexion during stance (SMD: 0.374, 95% CI 0.098-0.649, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008, I<sup>2</sup>: 0%); greater knee abduction at initial contact (IC) (SMD: 0.687, 95% CI 0.299-1.076, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, I<sup>2</sup>: 55%); less hip internal rotation (SMD: 0.437, 95% CI 0.134-0.741, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005, I<sup>2</sup>: 34%) and hip abduction at IC (SMD: -0.454, 95% CI 0.151-0.758, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003, I<sup>2</sup>: 33%). No significant differences were observed between males and females for any internal or externally applied KJLs. All retrieved studies failed to control for strength, resistance training or skill history status.<br>CONCLUSION: No differences were observed in KJLs between males and females despite females displaying greater knee abduction at IC and less peak knee flexion during the stance phase of CODs, which are visual characteristics of non-contact ACL injury. Further research is required to examine if this translates to a similar injury risk, considering morphological differences in strain characteristics of the ACL between males and females. This observation may in part explain the disproportionate ACL injury incidence in female multidirectional athletes. Further higher quality controlled research is required whereby participants are matched by skill training history, resistance training history and strength status to ensure an appropriate comparison between males and females.<br>',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A subgroup of patients with low back pain (LBP) suffers from low back-related leg pain (LBLP), which can be classified as radicular pain, or somatic referred pain without nerve root involvement. LBLP is considered an obstacle to recovery and a strong negative prognostic factor for medium- and long-term disability. In this review, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness and optimal dose of resistance training (RT) in patients with subacute or persistent LBLP to provide clinical recommendations for practice. This systematic review&#xa0;was conducted by adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic&#xa0;Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. We conducted a literature search&#xa0;on PubMed, PEDro, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients &#x2265;18 years of age were included. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using \"the Cochrane Collaboration\\'s tool for assessing risk of bias\" (RoB) and the inter-rater agreement for full-text selection was evaluated using Cohen\\'s Kappa (K). The search elicited a total of 4.537 records, and two RCTs involving a total of 196 participants were identified through a selection process based on title, abstract, and full-text assessment. Both studies had a low to moderate risk of bias. The inter-examiner concordance index for the selection of full text was excellent (K=1). RT seems to be an effective and safe intervention for patients with LBLP, but its long-term effectiveness, superiority over other types of exercise-based therapies, and optimal dosage still constitute a gray area in the literature.',\n",

       " 3: {'pubmed_title': 'Sex differences in the physiological responses to cardiac rehabilitation: a systematic review.',\n",
       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in Canada. Many heart disease patients are referred for cardiac rehabilitation, a multidisciplinary outpatient program often consisting of exercise training. Cardiac rehabilitation has been proven to be a successful secondary preventative measure in reducing mortality and improving overall health in heart disease patients, and its completion is important for both sexes as there is growing evidence that women benefit as much as men, if not more, with regard to mortality. It is important to note that previous studies have shown that healthy men and women respond differently to aerobic and resistance training, possibly due to hormones, body composition, autonomic and/or cardiovascular differences. However, evaluating sex differences in the efficacy of standard cardiac rehabilitation programs has not yet been fully explored with many studies investigating clinical or anthropometric data but not physiological outcomes. This systematic review aimed to investigate physiological differences in male and female heart disease patients after cardiac rehabilitation. The inclusion criteria were purposefully broad to encompass many cardiac rehabilitation scenarios, many cardiac disease states, and various program lengths and intensities with the intention of highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the current body of literature.<br>METHODS: To conduct a synthesis without meta-analysis, a search strategy was generated to examine the relationships between heart disease patients, a supervised exercise program, physiological outcomes, and sex differences. The review was registered (Prospero: CRD42021251614) and the following databases were searched from inception to 19 December 2023: APA PsycInfo (Ovid), CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost), Embase (Ovid), Emcare Nursing (Ovid), Medline All (Ovid; includes PubMed non-Medline), and Web of Science Core Collection. Eighty-eight studies pertaining to fitness, metabolism, body composition, respiratory function, cardiac function and C-reactive protein underwent data extraction.<br>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Importantly, this review suggests that men and women respond similarly to a wide-range of cardiac rehabilitation programs in most physiological variables. However, many studies discussing maximal oxygen consumption, functional capacity, six-minute walk distances, and grip strength suggest that men benefit more. Further research is required to address certain limitations, such as appropriate statistical methods and type/intensity of exercise interventions.<br>',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the effects of low-load blood flow restriction training (LL-BFRT) on muscle anabolism and thrombotic biomarkers compared with the effects of traditional LL training and to analyse the changes in these biomarkers in the short and medium term (acute/immediate and after at least 4 weeks of the training programme, respectively). A search was conducted in the following electronic databases from inception to 1 March 2024: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Web of Science, PEDro, Science Direct, CINHAL, and Scopus. A total of 13 randomized controlled trials were included, with a total of 256 healthy older adults (mean (min-max) age 68 (62-71) years, 44.53% female). The outcome measures were muscle anabolism biomarkers and thrombosis biomarkers. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated to compare the outcomes reported by the studies. The overall meta-analysis showed that LL-BFRT produces a large increase in muscle anabolism biomarkers compared with traditional LL training (eight studies; SMD = 0.88 [0.39; 1.37]) and compared with a passive control (four studies; SMD = 0.91 [0.54; 1.29]). LL-BFRT does not produce an increase in thrombotic biomarkers compared with traditional LL training (four studies; SMD = -0.02 [-0.41; 0.36]) or compared with a passive control (two studies; SMD = 0.20 [-0.41; 0.80]). The increase in muscle anabolism biomarkers was large after applying a single session (four studies; SMD = 1.29 [0.18; 2.41]) and moderate after applying a training programme (four studies; SMD = 0.58 [0.09; 1.06]). In conclusion, LL-BFRT increases muscle anabolism biomarkers to a greater extent than traditional LL training (low-quality evidence) or a passive control (moderate-quality evidence) in healthy older adults. This superior anabolic potential of LL-BFRT compared with LL training is sustained in the short to medium term. LL-BFRT is a safe training methodology for older adults, showing moderate-quality evidence of no increase in thrombotic biomarkers compared with traditional LL training.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Irisin, a myokine that is responsive to exercise, induces significant changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue. By promoting the browning of white fat tissue, it enhances energy expenditure, thereby addressing overweight and obesity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the effects of different types of physical exercises on irisin levels in overweight and obese adults.<br>METHODS: Specifically, the review focused on studies involving obese or overweight individuals who participated in exercise training for a minimum of 8 weeks, with measured and reported changes in serum irisin levels compared to a control group. Data were collected from four databases (Google Scholar, ISI Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, and Scopus). The risk of bias was assessed using the Begg and Egger tests, and the results were synthesized.<br>RESULTS: Initial searches identified 560 titles, out of which only seven met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant increase in serum irisin concentration (SMD = 0.957, <i>P</i> = 0.005) among obese and overweight individuals who engaged in exercise, compared to the passive control group. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) (SMD = 1.229, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) had a more pronounced effect on increasing serum irisin levels than other exercise protocols. Furthermore, the effectiveness of exercise varied based on the participants' weight status (significant changes for overweight individuals; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 and insignificant changes for obese individuals; <i>P</i> = 0.1), age (significant changes for those under 40 years old; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 and insignificant changes for those over 40 years old; <i>P</i> = 0.322), and gender (significant changes for men; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 and insignificant changes for women; <i>P</i> = 0.285).<br>CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, exercise can elevate serum irisin levels, leading to alterations in adipose tissue phenotype and thermogenesis, ultimately contributing to weight reduction in obese and overweight individuals.<br>\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Change of direction (COD) movements are associated with non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in multidirectional sports. Females appear at increased risk compared to males, which could be attributable to whole body kinematic strategies and greater multiplanar knee joint loads (KJLs) during COD which can increase ACL loading.<br>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine and quantitatively synthesise the evidence for differences between males and females regarding KJLs and their biomechanical determinants (whole body kinematic strategies determining KJLs) during COD tasks.<br>METHODS: Databases including SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and PubMed were systematically searched (July 2021-June 2023) for studies that compared differences in knee joint loads and biomechanical determinants of KJLs during COD between males and females. Inclusion criteria were: (1) females and males with no prior history of ACL injury (18-40&#xa0;years); (2) examined biomechanical determinants of KJLs and/ or KJLs during COD tasks&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;20&#xb0;; (3) compared&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;1 outcome measure between males and females. Studies published between 2000 and 2023 examining a cutting task&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;20&#xb0; with a preceding approach run that compared KJLs or the whole body multiplanar kinematics associated with them, between sexes, using three-dimensional motion analysis.<br>RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 17 studies with a pooled sample size of 451 participants (227 males, 224 females). Meta-analysis revealed females displayed significantly less peak knee flexion during stance (SMD: 0.374, 95% CI 0.098-0.649, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.008, I<sup>2</sup>: 0%); greater knee abduction at initial contact (IC) (SMD: 0.687, 95% CI 0.299-1.076, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001, I<sup>2</sup>: 55%); less hip internal rotation (SMD: 0.437, 95% CI 0.134-0.741, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005, I<sup>2</sup>: 34%) and hip abduction at IC (SMD: -0.454, 95% CI 0.151-0.758, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003, I<sup>2</sup>: 33%). No significant differences were observed between males and females for any internal or externally applied KJLs. All retrieved studies failed to control for strength, resistance training or skill history status.<br>CONCLUSION: No differences were observed in KJLs between males and females despite females displaying greater knee abduction at IC and less peak knee flexion during the stance phase of CODs, which are visual characteristics of non-contact ACL injury. Further research is required to examine if this translates to a similar injury risk, considering morphological differences in strain characteristics of the ACL between males and females. This observation may in part explain the disproportionate ACL injury incidence in female multidirectional athletes. Further higher quality controlled research is required whereby participants are matched by skill training history, resistance training history and strength status to ensure an appropriate comparison between males and females.<br>',\n",
