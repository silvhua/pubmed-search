This study aimed to explore home rehabilitation therapists' experiences of supporting physical exercise after acute hospitalization, including exercise programs initiated during hospital stay.

Twelve interviews were conducted with physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and managers across seven rehabilitation therapy services in Stockholm, Sweden.

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including crossover RCTs with adults with stable COPD. We included trials using oxygen therapy with HFNC during the exercise training component of a PR programme. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL), exercise capacity (EC) and adverse events. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: treatment adherence, breathlessness and future exacerbations. RESULTS: We included five studies with 300 participants with moderate to severe COPD. The certainty of the evidence was primarily low or very low for all outcomes of interest due to risk of bias, inconsistency or imprecision. HFNC has little to no difference in HRQoL (4 studies, 129 participants, MD 0.17, 95% CI -1.20 to 1.54; I<sup>2</sup> 50%). HFNC may result in little to no difference in EC (3 studies, 212 participants, mean difference 18.73, 95% CI -20.49 to 28.94; I<sup>2</sup> 56%), and we are uncertain about the effect of HFNC on breathlessness (4 studies; 244 participants, MD of -0.07, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.26; I<sup>2</sup> 63%). Only one study with 44 participants reported a participant's withdrawal because of progressive dyspnoea during lower limb exercise. CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain about the effect of HFNC during the exercise component of a PR programme in HRQoL, EC or dyspnoea compared to usual care or conventional supplementary oxygen. Non-domiciliary oxygen patients showed improvements in HRQoL, EC and dyspnoea.\", 'mesh_headings': None, 'keywords': ['chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'exercise therapy', 'high flow nasal cannula', 'oxygen inhalation therapy', 'quality of life', 'rehabilitation', 'systematic review'], 'major_topics': None, 'pmid': '38581398', 'doi': '10.1002/pri.2088', 'volume': '29', 'issue': '2', 'year': '2024', 'month': None, 'start_page': 'e2088', 'end_page': None, 'authors': ['Oltra Gisela', 'Ricciardelli Mariela', 'Virgilio Sacha', 'Fernandez Parmo Delfina', 'Ruiz Ang&#xe9;lica', 'Liquitay Camila Micaela Escobar', 'Garegnani Luis'], 'publication_type': ['Journal Article', 'Review'], 'source_id': 'd803813e6fb2318f09b571a7e1afd43092b1ee3113542162cacdce41460f5a99'}, embedding: vector of size 768), Document(id=d000c4b74f6eec1fe0fc35a195528b124ebd209c66375fb73eac866074325ed8, content: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In this review, we discuss evidence concerning the management of psoriatic...', meta: {'article_title': 'Non-Pharmacological Interventions for Treating Psoriatic Arthritis.', 'journal': 'Alternative therapies in health and medicine', 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In this review, we discuss evidence concerning the management of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients with non-pharmacological interventions and additionally develop physical training protocols that could be prescribed to these patients.

The RE-AIM framework considers the essential elements to assess the external and internal validity of interventions through five dimensions: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (Am J Public Health. 1999;89(9):1322-1327). Subsequently, the review aimed to provide suggestions regarding strategies to enhance the planning and evaluation of evidence-based programs for parent education in sport. Overall, the analysis demonstrated that most studies presented some pertinent evaluation information related to the RE-AIM framework, such as the number of participants and contacts made, the measures used, and the program level. However, the studies also lacked information on participant exclusion criteria, the method used to select the delivery agent (e.g., parents engaged in the program), and cost measures.

RESULTS: At rest, clot microstructure (1.69&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.07 vs. 1.64&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.05, corresponding to a difference of ~&#x2009;50% in normalized clot mass; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) and thrombocyte count (73%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) were higher, and activated partial thromboplastin time was lower (18%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001) in stroke patients compared to age-matched controls.

MetS (outcome of interest) was assessed through five criteria related to waist circumference, blood glucose, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and a sum score was created for analysis. We ran partial correlations to examine the association between fitness score at baseline and MetS score at 29-years follow-up, adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic status, smoking status, sleep quality, and physical activity engagement in minutes/ week. RESULTS: A higher fitness score at baseline was significantly associated with a lower MetS score indicative of better metabolic health at 29-years follow-up (r=-0.29; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011). These associations were present in participants aged&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;40 years (r=-0.33; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025) as well as those aged&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;40 years (r=-0.43; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045).

Motor-cognitive training in the home is scarcely investigated and eHealth methods can provide continual support for PD self-management. Feasibility testing is however required. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility (i) Recruitment capability (ii) Acceptability and Suitability (iii) Demand and Safety of a home-based motor-cognitive eHealth exercise intervention in PD. METHODS: The 10-week intervention was delivered using the ExorLive&#xae; application and exercises were individually adapted and systematically progressed and targeted functional strength, cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, and motor-cognitive function. People with mild-to moderate PD were assessed before and after the intervention regarding; gait performance in single and dual-task conditions; functional mobility; dual-task performance; balance performance; physical activity level; health related quality of life and perceived balance confidence and walking ability; global cognition and executive function. Feasibility outcomes were continuously measured using a home-exercise diary and contact with a physiotherapist. Changes from pre- and post-intervention are reported descriptively. RESULTS: Fifteen participants (mean age 68.5 years) commenced and 14 completed the 10-week intervention. In relation to intervention Acceptability, 64% of the motor sessions and 52% of motor-cognitive sessions were rated as \"enjoyable\". Concerning Suitability, the average level of exertion (Borg RPE scale) was light (11-12). Adherence was high, with 86% of all (420) sessions reported as completed. No falls or other adverse events occurred in conjunction with the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This motor-cognitive eHealth home exercise intervention for PD was safe and feasible in terms of Recruitment capability, Acceptability, Safety and Demand. The intensity of physical challenge needs to be increased before testing in an efficacy trial.

In-hospital exercise interventions can mitigate this decline, and continued support from primary healthcare post-discharge may enhance sustainability. This study aimed to explore home rehabilitation therapists' experiences of supporting physical exercise after acute hospitalization, including exercise programs initiated during hospital stay. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted alongside a randomized-controlled trial to investigate prerequisites for a transitional care intervention. Twelve interviews were conducted with physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and managers across seven rehabilitation therapy services in Stockholm, Sweden. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The analysis generated the theme Striving for individualized support for physical exercise, although limited resources and a fragmented home care risk to direct support away from those who need it the most. It was based on four subthemes: The starting point is always the patient's current needs, goals, and prerequisites, Continuing the exercise initiated during hospitalization by adapting it to the patient's situation at home, Work premises not tailored to patients with complex care needs, and A home care organization that lacks coordination and unified purpose.

Quantitative data on the myofibre morphology in sIBM remains scarce. Further, no previous study has examined fibre type association of satellite cells (SC), myonuclei number, macrophages, capillaries, and myonuclear domain (MD) in sIBM patients. Muscle biopsies from sIBM patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18) obtained previously (NCT02317094) were included in the analysis for fibre type-specific myofibre cross-sectional area (mCSA), SCs, myonuclei and macrophages, myonuclear domain, and capillarisation. mCSA (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), peripheral myonuclei (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and MD (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) were higher in association with type 1 (slow-twitch) than type 2 (fast-twitch) fibres. Conversely, quiescent SCs (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), centrally placed myonuclei (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), M1 macrophages (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002), M2 macrophages (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) and capillaries (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) were higher at type 2 fibres compared to type 1 fibres. In contrast, proliferating (Pax7<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>+</sup>) SCs (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68) were similarly associated with each fibre type.

These findings are predominantly derived from small, single-centre exercise trials conducted in outpatient rehabilitation facilities. In recent years, the delivery of exercise interventions remotely has increased through digital communications technology (telerehabilitation). However, very little research to date has been conducted into the efficacy of telerehabilitation in people with a congenital heart condition.

METHODS: One hundred eligible adolescent (&#x2265;&#x2009;16&#xa0;years) and adult participants living with a complex biventricular congenital heart condition will be recruited from four Australian sites and randomised to either (1) a 16-week telehealth-delivered combined (aerobic and resistance) exercise training programme of moderate-to-vigorous intensity or (2) usual care (control group), in a 1:1 allocation, with an 8-month follow-up. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: The primary outcome will be the change in aerobic capacity expressed as peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>). Secondary outcomes will include changes in vascular function, muscle oxygenation, metabolic profile, body composition and musculoskeletal fitness, neurohormonal activation, neurocognitive function, physical activity levels, dietary and nutritional status, and quality of life. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 16&#xa0;weeks, and 12&#xa0;months (to determine longer-term maintenance potential). DISCUSSION: If found to be efficacious, telerehabilitation may be an alternative option for delivering exercise, improving health outcomes, and increasing accessibility to exercise programmes. Efficacy data is required to quantify the clinical significance of this delivery mode of exercise.

CONCLUSION: The results show that exercise transiently increases the risk of blood clot formation in both stroke patients and controls, however, due to the higher baseline thrombogenicity in stroke patients, the post exercise risk of forming blood clots may be higher in this group.

RESULTS: At rest, clot microstructure (1.69&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.07 vs. 1.64&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.05, corresponding to a difference of ~&#x2009;50% in normalized clot mass; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) and thrombocyte count (73%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) were higher, and activated partial thromboplastin time was lower (18%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001) in stroke patients compared to age-matched controls.

These associations were present in participants aged&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;40 years (r=-0.33; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025) as well as those aged&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;40 years (r=-0.43; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Fitness may be a predictor of longitudinal metabolic health, and potentially also mediates previously reported longitudinal associations between physical activity and metabolic health.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility (i) Recruitment capability (ii) Acceptability and Suitability (iii) Demand and Safety of a home-based motor-cognitive eHealth exercise intervention in PD. METHODS: The 10-week intervention was delivered using the ExorLive&#xae; application and exercises were individually adapted and systematically progressed and targeted functional strength, cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, and motor-cognitive function. People with mild-to moderate PD were assessed before and after the intervention regarding; gait performance in single and dual-task conditions; functional mobility; dual-task performance; balance performance; physical activity level; health related quality of life and perceived balance confidence and walking ability; global cognition and executive function. Feasibility outcomes were continuously measured using a home-exercise diary and contact with a physiotherapist. Changes from pre- and post-intervention are reported descriptively. RESULTS: Fifteen participants (mean age 68.5 years) commenced and 14 completed the 10-week intervention.

       "  'abstract': \"PURPOSE: After hospitalization, older persons may face a decline in physical function and daily independence. In-hospital exercise interventions can mitigate this decline, and continued support from primary healthcare post-discharge may enhance sustainability. This study aimed to explore home rehabilitation therapists' experiences of supporting physical exercise after acute hospitalization, including exercise programs initiated during hospital stay. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted alongside a randomized-controlled trial to investigate prerequisites for a transitional care intervention. Twelve interviews were conducted with physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and managers across seven rehabilitation therapy services in Stockholm, Sweden. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The analysis generated the theme Striving for individualized support for physical exercise, although limited resources and a fragmented home care risk to direct support away from those who need it the most. It was based on four subthemes: The starting point is always the patient's current needs, goals, and prerequisites, Continuing the exercise initiated during hospitalization by adapting it to the patient's situation at home, Work premises not tailored to patients with complex care needs, and A home care organization that lacks coordination and unified purpose. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions supporting older persons to physical exercise after acute hospitalization need to be tailored to the individual, support motivation, and be adapted to the patient's home situation. Challenges may arise when care recourses lack alignment with the patients' needs, and when the collaboration among care providers is limited. The findings contribute valuable insights for future studies incorporating transitional care interventions in similar context.\",\n",

METHODS AND RESULTS: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted in 2023 in Kumamoto Prefecture, where 106 hospitals provide cardiology services. Ninety-three (88%) of the hospitals completed questionnaires regarding TTE. The severity of low flow/low gradient AS was evaluated by dobutamine stress echocardiography in only 7% of hospitals and exercise stress echocardiography for asymptomatic mitral regurgitation in only 5%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that participation in remote multi-institutional echocardiographic meetings and use of the Kumamoto Prefecture echocardiographic manual were significantly associated with the use of a multi-window approach (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In Kumamoto Prefecture, echocardiographic measurements are performed according to the recommendations at a relatively low rate.

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Rugby is a sport involving a great number of shoulder collisions. Traumatic stress of the shoulder can weaken the static stabilizers and promote major injuries as dislocation or full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff. The goal of this study is to evaluate the clinical and ultrasonographic dominant shoulder factures in a group of amateur rugby players, with no history of shoulder injuries, and to compare them with those of a control group. METHODS: 52 male subjects join in the study: 26 amateur rugby players and 26 subjects, which did not practice rugby or competitive sport. Clinical history was obtained from all subjects, followed by dominant shoulder physical and ultrasonographic exams. RESULTS: Rugby players showed a higher prevalence of positive clinical test, suggesting subacromial impingement than control group (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Among rugby group, five players (19,2%) showed positive test for radiculopathy (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0,02), and ten players (73,1%) reported shoulder pain needing pain-reliever drugs at list one time in the last six months (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). In rugby group, ultrasound exams showed 23,1% degenerative changes and 30,8% tendon calcifications in supraspinatus tendons (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Uninjured dominant shoulder of rugby players shows higher prevalence of clinical and ultrasound changes compare to control. Some rugby players without history of cervical symptoms show positive clinical test of cervical radiculopathy. Clinical and ultrasonographic monitoring of the shoulder can play a role in prevention and knowledge of silent shoulder damage in these athletes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': ': The author has provided an alternative biofeedback method to help maintain the effortful swallowing (ES) maneuver target effort to utilize a constantly high swallowing pressure. The author has identified ES with visual feedback (i.e. the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI)) produced higher EMG activation levels than without. However, the author accepted higher activation levels as higher muscle force production, attributed the lower EMG activation levels in 4th set to fatigue, and did not consider other possibilities. As the author stated in the discussion \"his/her method caused participants to focus more efforts to achieve the goal\" in feedback condition and enhanced the participant\\'s focus on the exercise plan. This situation, caused by the focus of attention, can be explained with the \"constrained action hypothesis\". Also, EMG levels are highly correlated to muscle force, but EMG does not directly measure the force produced. This causes some unpredictable factors that can influence the force but not the EMG data. To conclude, the increased EMG activity or the participants\\' negative feedback could be caused by the focus of attention, and future studies should consider this perspective.',\n",

       "  'abstract': ': Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is a subgroup of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies characterised by progressive muscle weakness and skeletal muscle inflammation. Quantitative data on the myofibre morphology in sIBM remains scarce. Further, no previous study has examined fibre type association of satellite cells (SC), myonuclei number, macrophages, capillaries, and myonuclear domain (MD) in sIBM patients. Muscle biopsies from sIBM patients (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18) obtained previously (NCT02317094) were included in the analysis for fibre type-specific myofibre cross-sectional area (mCSA), SCs, myonuclei and macrophages, myonuclear domain, and capillarisation. mCSA (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), peripheral myonuclei (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and MD (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005) were higher in association with type 1 (slow-twitch) than type 2 (fast-twitch) fibres. Conversely, quiescent SCs (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), centrally placed myonuclei (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03), M1 macrophages (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.002), M2 macrophages (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.013) and capillaries (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) were higher at type 2 fibres compared to type 1 fibres. In contrast, proliferating (Pax7<sup>+</sup>/Ki67<sup>+</sup>) SCs (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.68) were similarly associated with each fibre type. Type 2 myofibres of late-phase sIBM patients showed marked signs of muscle atrophy (i.e. reduced mCSA) accompanied by higher numbers of associated quiescent SCs, centrally placed myonuclei, macrophages and capillaries compared to type 1 fibres. In contrast, type 1 fibres were suffering from pathological enlargement with larger MDs as well as fewer nuclei and capillaries per area when compared with type 2 fibres. More research is needed to examine to which extent different therapeutic interventions including targeted exercise might alleviate these fibre type-specific characteristics and countermeasure their consequences in impaired functional performance.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an increasingly concerning global public health issue due to its high burden of morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a comprehensive intervention to improve patients' physical and psychological conditions, commonly involving oxygen supplementation. The potential benefits of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) have recently sparked interest as oxygen therapy. In this context, this study aims to assess the effects of HFNC during the exercise training component of a PR program in people with COPD. METHODS: Systematic review (CRD42022330929). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including crossover RCTs with adults with stable COPD. We included trials using oxygen therapy with HFNC during the exercise training component of a PR programme. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL), exercise capacity (EC) and adverse events. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: treatment adherence, breathlessness and future exacerbations. RESULTS: We included five studies with 300 participants with moderate to severe COPD. The certainty of the evidence was primarily low or very low for all outcomes of interest due to risk of bias, inconsistency or imprecision. HFNC has little to no difference in HRQoL (4 studies, 129 participants, MD 0.17, 95% CI -1.20 to 1.54; I<sup>2</sup> 50%). HFNC may result in little to no difference in EC (3 studies, 212 participants, mean difference 18.73, 95% CI -20.49 to 28.94; I<sup>2</sup> 56%), and we are uncertain about the effect of HFNC on breathlessness (4 studies; 244 participants, MD of -0.07, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.26; I<sup>2</sup> 63%). Only one study with 44 participants reported a participant's withdrawal because of progressive dyspnoea during lower limb exercise. CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain about the effect of HFNC during the exercise component of a PR programme in HRQoL, EC or dyspnoea compared to usual care or conventional supplementary oxygen. Non-domiciliary oxygen patients showed improvements in HRQoL, EC and dyspnoea.\",\n",

METHODS: We selected 110 articles, published on PubMed and Google Scholar databases from 1972 to date, investigating the effects of generic hygienic-dietary recommendations and training programs in PsA or psoriasis (PSO) individuals. RESULTS: Although data in support are limited, aerobic, endurance, and strength exercises as well as complementary techniques may all be useful in preserving or improving residual functional capacity, joint flexibility, and muscle strength. Exercise may reduce systemic inflammation, pain, and fatigue and additionally control PsA comorbidities, like dysmetabolism or obesity. CONCLUSIONS: The polyhedral clinical expression of PsA underlines the need for a multidisciplinary approach combining the synergistic effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. The latter range from preventive measures, like dietary modifications, weight loss, and cigarette smoking cessation, to personalized training protocols according to disease activity and phenotype, comorbidities, and individual tolerability. In these patients, we strongly encourage the regular practice of motor activity at progressively increasing intensity with combined supervised aerobic, strength, endurance, and stretching exercises.',\n",

       "  'abstract': ': In recent years, there has been an increase in the delivery and evaluation of parent education programs within youth sport. Subsequently, some recent reviews of these programs have been conducted. However, one consistent issue across many of the programs and associated review papers is the lack of an appropriate evaluation framework to guide the planning or associated reporting of the outcomes of the interventions. This has limited understanding of the overall impact of sport parenting interventions. Thus, the purposes of the current study were as follows: (a) to identify commonalities in the reporting and evaluation of parent education programs; (b) to identify gaps in the reporting and evaluation of parent education programs; (c) to draw these insights together to provide suggestions regarding how the RE-AIM could be used to enhance planning and evaluation of evidence-based programs for parent education in sport. Specifically, utilizing the RE-AIM framework to provide insights into pertinent evaluation metrics, this integrative review aimed to identify commonalities and gaps in the reporting of parent education programs. The RE-AIM framework considers the essential elements to assess the external and internal validity of interventions through five dimensions: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (Am J Public Health. 1999;89(9):1322-1327). Subsequently, the review aimed to provide suggestions regarding strategies to enhance the planning and evaluation of evidence-based programs for parent education in sport. Overall, the analysis demonstrated that most studies presented some pertinent evaluation information related to the RE-AIM framework, such as the number of participants and contacts made, the measures used, and the program level. However, the studies also lacked information on participant exclusion criteria, the method used to select the delivery agent (e.g., parents engaged in the program), and cost measures. Overall, the current study identified various areas where programs could be enhanced, specifically related to reporting procedural elements (e.g., program design, target population, and costs) pertaining to the implementation of parent education programs.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Accumulated evidence suggests that exercise training exerts beneficial effects on people with congenital heart conditions. These findings are predominantly derived from small, single-centre exercise trials conducted in outpatient rehabilitation facilities. In recent years, the delivery of exercise interventions remotely has increased through digital communications technology (telerehabilitation). However, very little research to date has been conducted into the efficacy of telerehabilitation in people with a congenital heart condition. AIMS: To evaluate the effects of a telehealth-delivered exercise intervention in people with a history of a surgical biventricular repair due to a congenital heart condition. METHODS: One hundred eligible adolescent (&#x2265;&#x2009;16&#xa0;years) and adult participants living with a complex biventricular congenital heart condition will be recruited from four Australian sites and randomised to either (1) a 16-week telehealth-delivered combined (aerobic and resistance) exercise training programme of moderate-to-vigorous intensity or (2) usual care (control group), in a 1:1 allocation, with an 8-month follow-up. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: The primary outcome will be the change in aerobic capacity expressed as peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>). Secondary outcomes will include changes in vascular function, muscle oxygenation, metabolic profile, body composition and musculoskeletal fitness, neurohormonal activation, neurocognitive function, physical activity levels, dietary and nutritional status, and quality of life. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 16&#xa0;weeks, and 12&#xa0;months (to determine longer-term maintenance potential). DISCUSSION: If found to be efficacious, telerehabilitation may be an alternative option for delivering exercise, improving health outcomes, and increasing accessibility to exercise programmes. Efficacy data is required to quantify the clinical significance of this delivery mode of exercise.

METHODS: Clot microstructure and conventional markers of thrombotic risk were determined in twenty lacunar stroke patients and fifteen healthy age-matched controls before, immediately after and 1&#xa0;h after a bout of moderate intensity cycling exercise. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model approach. RESULTS: At rest, clot microstructure (1.69&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.07 vs. 1.64&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.05, corresponding to a difference of ~&#x2009;50% in normalized clot mass; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.009) and thrombocyte count (73%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001) were higher, and activated partial thromboplastin time was lower (18%; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001) in stroke patients compared to age-matched controls. Acute exercise increased thrombogenic markers similarly in the two groups: incipient clot microstructure (1.69&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.07 vs. 1.74&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.05; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0004 and 1.64&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.05 vs. 1.71&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.04; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001, for stroke and controls respectively), plasma fibrinogen (12%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001 and 18%; p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001, for stroke and controls respectively) and the combined coagulation factors II, VII and X (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.0001 and p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.0001, for stroke and controls respectively). CONCLUSION: The results show that exercise transiently increases the risk of blood clot formation in both stroke patients and controls, however, due to the higher baseline thrombogenicity in stroke patients, the post exercise risk of forming blood clots may be higher in this group.

       "  'abstract': 'OBJECTIVES: To examine the longitudinal associations between fitness and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in community-dwelling adults over 29 years of follow-up. DESIGN: Ongoing, population-based cohort study of adults aged&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;33 years at baseline residing in the city of Bad Sch&#xf6;nborn, Germany. METHODS: The sample comprised 89 persons (41 females; mean age 40.1 years at baseline) who participated at baseline (in the year 1992) and 29-years follow-up (in the year 2021). Fitness (predictor variable) was assessed using 15 standardized and validated tests that measured strength, gross motor coordination, mobility/ flexibility and cardiorespiratory fitness/ endurance, and a z-transformed fitness score was calculated for analysis. MetS (outcome of interest) was assessed through five criteria related to waist circumference, blood glucose, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and a sum score was created for analysis. We ran partial correlations to examine the association between fitness score at baseline and MetS score at 29-years follow-up, adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic status, smoking status, sleep quality, and physical activity engagement in minutes/ week. RESULTS: A higher fitness score at baseline was significantly associated with a lower MetS score indicative of better metabolic health at 29-years follow-up (r=-0.29; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011). These associations were present in participants aged&#x2009;&#x2264;&#x2009;40 years (r=-0.33; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.025) as well as those aged&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;40 years (r=-0.43; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Fitness may be a predictor of longitudinal metabolic health, and potentially also mediates previously reported longitudinal associations between physical activity and metabolic health. More research is needed to confirm these observations, and to also explore underlying mechanisms.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Parkinson\\'s disease (PD) drastically affects motor and cognitive function, but evidence shows that motor-cognitive training improves disease symptoms. Motor-cognitive training in the home is scarcely investigated and eHealth methods can provide continual support for PD self-management. Feasibility testing is however required. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility (i) Recruitment capability (ii) Acceptability and Suitability (iii) Demand and Safety of a home-based motor-cognitive eHealth exercise intervention in PD. METHODS: The 10-week intervention was delivered using the ExorLive&#xae; application and exercises were individually adapted and systematically progressed and targeted functional strength, cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, and motor-cognitive function. People with mild-to moderate PD were assessed before and after the intervention regarding; gait performance in single and dual-task conditions; functional mobility; dual-task performance; balance performance; physical activity level; health related quality of life and perceived balance confidence and walking ability; global cognition and executive function. Feasibility outcomes were continuously measured using a home-exercise diary and contact with a physiotherapist. Changes from pre- and post-intervention are reported descriptively. RESULTS: Fifteen participants (mean age 68.5 years) commenced and 14 completed the 10-week intervention. In relation to intervention Acceptability, 64% of the motor sessions and 52% of motor-cognitive sessions were rated as \"enjoyable\". Concerning Suitability, the average level of exertion (Borg RPE scale) was light (11-12). Adherence was high, with 86% of all (420) sessions reported as completed. No falls or other adverse events occurred in conjunction with the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This motor-cognitive eHealth home exercise intervention for PD was safe and feasible in terms of Recruitment capability, Acceptability, Safety and Demand. The intensity of physical challenge needs to be increased before testing in an efficacy trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05027620).',\n",

       "  'abstract': ': Advancing age is associated with declines in cognitive function. Although physical activity is thought to protect against this decline, it is unclear how a short-term uptake in daily steps or a decline in day-to-day step variability may contribute to cognition among older adults. We tested associations between changes in step counts, day-to-day step variability and executive cognitive functions among older adults taking part in a physical activity intervention. Thirty-seven older adults (33 females; 71.4&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.3&#xa0;years) completed a 10-week personalized physical activity intervention. Participants wore a Fitbit to measure daily step counts throughout the study. They also completed a computerized Stroop task before and after the intervention. Average step counts and step count variability via average-real-variability (ARV) were determined. Compared to pre-intervention, step counts increased (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and step variability decreased post-intervention (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04). Models describing the changes in step counts and ARV over the 10-weeks were cubic (both, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.04). Reaction times during the simple (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and switching (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04) conditions were faster post-intervention. Change in step variability was positively associated with the change in reaction time for the switching condition (&#x3b2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.029, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002). On average, a reduction in day-to-day step variability was associated with improvements in cognitive flexibility.',\n",

       "  'abstract': ': We examined the prevalence, risk factors, and association between pre-frailty and subsequent mortality after blood or marrow transplantation (BMT). Study participants were drawn from the BMT Survivor Study (BMTSS) and included 3346 individuals who underwent BMT between 1974 and 2014 at one of three transplant centers and survived &#x2265;2 years post-BMT. Participants completed the BMTSS survey at a median of 9 years from BMT and were followed for subsequent mortality for a median of 5 years after survey completion. Closest-age and same-sex biological siblings also completed the survey. Previously published self-reported indices (exhaustion, weakness, low energy expenditure, slowness, unintentional weight loss) classified participants as non-frail (0-1 indices) or pre-frail (2 indices). National Death Index was used to determine vital status and cause of death. Overall, 626 (18.7%) BMT survivors were pre-frail. BMT survivors had a 3.2-fold higher odds of being pre-frail (95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.9-5.3) compared to siblings. Compared to non-frail survivors, pre-frail survivors had higher hazards of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.6, 95% CI&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.4-2.0). Female sex, pre-BMT radiation, smoking, lack of exercise, anxiety, and severe/life-threatening chronic health conditions were associated with pre-frailty. The novel association between pre-frailty and subsequent mortality provides evidence for interventions as pre-frail individuals may transition back to their robust state.',\n",

AP affects periradicular tissues and has systemic repercussions. Physical exercise is a structured activity that requires cardiorespiratory function, and can modulate the inflammatory profile in pathological conditions. As a result, this study aimed to determine the effects of aerobic physical training (PT) on the alveolar bone with and without AP, and its systemic inflammatory repercussions. AP was induced in the mandibular first molars, and PT was performed on a treadmill for five consecutive days over four weeks, with progressive increases in speed and activity time. Blood samples were collected to determine serum cytokine levels using immunoassays, and alveolar bone samples were collected for histopathological evaluation, lesion volume and microarchitecture assessment using computed microtomography. Animals with AP had increased pro-inflammatory cytokines levels compared to those without AP; however, these levels were attenuated or restored by PT. Compared to the AP group, the AP&#x2009;+&#x2009;PT group had a smaller lesion volume and greater preservation of the bone trabeculae in the remaining alveolar bone surrounding the lesion. In overall, PT minimized the severity of AP proving to be a valid strategy for individuals undergoing endodontic treatment.',\n",

In-hospital exercise interventions can mitigate this decline, and continued support from primary healthcare post-discharge may enhance sustainability. This study aimed to explore home rehabilitation therapists' experiences of supporting physical exercise after acute hospitalization, including exercise programs initiated during hospital stay. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted alongside a randomized-controlled trial to investigate prerequisites for a transitional care intervention. Twelve interviews were conducted with physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and managers across seven rehabilitation therapy services in Stockholm, Sweden. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The analysis generated the theme Striving for individualized support for physical exercise, although limited resources and a fragmented home care risk to direct support away from those who need it the most. It was based on four subthemes: The starting point is always the patient's current needs, goals, and prerequisites, Continuing the exercise initiated during hospitalization by adapting it to the patient's situation at home, Work premises not tailored to patients with complex care needs, and A home care organization that lacks coordination and unified purpose. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions supporting older persons to physical exercise after acute hospitalization need to be tailored to the individual, support motivation, and be adapted to the patient's home situation. Challenges may arise when care recourses lack alignment with the patients' needs, and when the collaboration among care providers is limited.

In this context, this study aims to assess the effects of HFNC during the exercise training component of a PR program in people with COPD. METHODS: Systematic review (CRD42022330929). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including crossover RCTs with adults with stable COPD. We included trials using oxygen therapy with HFNC during the exercise training component of a PR programme. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL), exercise capacity (EC) and adverse events. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: treatment adherence, breathlessness and future exacerbations. RESULTS: We included five studies with 300 participants with moderate to severe COPD. The certainty of the evidence was primarily low or very low for all outcomes of interest due to risk of bias, inconsistency or imprecision. HFNC has little to no difference in HRQoL (4 studies, 129 participants, MD 0.17, 95% CI -1.20 to 1.54; I<sup>2</sup> 50%). HFNC may result in little to no difference in EC (3 studies, 212 participants, mean difference 18.73, 95% CI -20.49 to 28.94; I<sup>2</sup> 56%), and we are uncertain about the effect of HFNC on breathlessness (4 studies; 244 participants, MD of -0.07, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.26; I<sup>2</sup> 63%). Only one study with 44 participants reported a participant's withdrawal because of progressive dyspnoea during lower limb exercise.

RESULTS: Although data in support are limited, aerobic, endurance, and strength exercises as well as complementary techniques may all be useful in preserving or improving residual functional capacity, joint flexibility, and muscle strength. Exercise may reduce systemic inflammation, pain, and fatigue and additionally control PsA comorbidities, like dysmetabolism or obesity. CONCLUSIONS: The polyhedral clinical expression of PsA underlines the need for a multidisciplinary approach combining the synergistic effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. The latter range from preventive measures, like dietary modifications, weight loss, and cigarette smoking cessation, to personalized training protocols according to disease activity and phenotype, comorbidities, and individual tolerability. In these patients, we strongly encourage the regular practice of motor activity at progressively increasing intensity with combined supervised aerobic, strength, endurance, and stretching exercises.', 'mesh_headings': '', 'keywords': '', 'major_topics': '', 'pmid': '38581338', 'doi': '', 'journal': 'Alternative therapies in health and medicine', 'volume': '', 'issue': '', 'year': '2024', 'month': '', 'start_page': '', 'end_page': '', 'authors': ['Talotta Rossella', 'Aiello Maria Rita', 'Restuccia Roberto', 'Magaudda Ludovico'], 'publication_type': ['Journal Article']}, {'article_title': 'An integrative review of parent education approaches in sport: Considerations for program planning and evaluation.', 'abstract': ': In recent years, there has been an increase in the delivery and evaluation of parent education programs within youth sport. Subsequently, some recent reviews of these programs have been conducted. However, one consistent issue across many of the programs and associated review papers is the lack of an appropriate evaluation framework to guide the planning or associated reporting of the outcomes of the interventions. This has limited understanding of the overall impact of sport parenting interventions. Thus, the purposes of the current study were as follows: (a) to identify commonalities in the reporting and evaluation of parent education programs; (b) to identify gaps in the reporting and evaluation of parent education programs; (c) to draw these insights together to provide suggestions regarding how the RE-AIM could be used to enhance planning and evaluation of evidence-based programs for parent education in sport. Specifically, utilizing the RE-AIM framework to provide insights into pertinent evaluation metrics, this integrative review aimed to identify commonalities and gaps in the reporting of parent education programs. The RE-AIM framework considers the essential elements to assess the external and internal validity of interventions through five dimensions: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (Am J Public Health. 1999;89(9):1322-1327). Subsequently, the review aimed to provide suggestions regarding strategies to enhance the planning and evaluation of evidence-based programs for parent education in sport. Overall, the analysis demonstrated that most studies presented some pertinent evaluation information related to the RE-AIM framework, such as the number of participants and contacts made, the measures used, and the program level. However, the studies also lacked information on participant exclusion criteria, the method used to select the delivery agent (e.g., parents engaged in the program), and cost measures.

These findings are predominantly derived from small, single-centre exercise trials conducted in outpatient rehabilitation facilities. In recent years, the delivery of exercise interventions remotely has increased through digital communications technology (telerehabilitation). However, very little research to date has been conducted into the efficacy of telerehabilitation in people with a congenital heart condition. AIMS: To evaluate the effects of a telehealth-delivered exercise intervention in people with a history of a surgical biventricular repair due to a congenital heart condition. METHODS: One hundred eligible adolescent (&#x2265;&#x2009;16&#xa0;years) and adult participants living with a complex biventricular congenital heart condition will be recruited from four Australian sites and randomised to either (1) a 16-week telehealth-delivered combined (aerobic and resistance) exercise training programme of moderate-to-vigorous intensity or (2) usual care (control group), in a 1:1 allocation, with an 8-month follow-up. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: The primary outcome will be the change in aerobic capacity expressed as peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>). Secondary outcomes will include changes in vascular function, muscle oxygenation, metabolic profile, body composition and musculoskeletal fitness, neurohormonal activation, neurocognitive function, physical activity levels, dietary and nutritional status, and quality of life. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 16&#xa0;weeks, and 12&#xa0;months (to determine longer-term maintenance potential). DISCUSSION: If found to be efficacious, telerehabilitation may be an alternative option for delivering exercise, improving health outcomes, and increasing accessibility to exercise programmes. Efficacy data is required to quantify the clinical significance of this delivery mode of exercise.

DESIGN: Ongoing, population-based cohort study of adults aged&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;33 years at baseline residing in the city of Bad Sch&#xf6;nborn, Germany. METHODS: The sample comprised 89 persons (41 females; mean age 40.1 years at baseline) who participated at baseline (in the year 1992) and 29-years follow-up (in the year 2021). Fitness (predictor variable) was assessed using 15 standardized and validated tests that measured strength, gross motor coordination, mobility/ flexibility and cardiorespiratory fitness/ endurance, and a z-transformed fitness score was calculated for analysis. MetS (outcome of interest) was assessed through five criteria related to waist circumference, blood glucose, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and a sum score was created for analysis. We ran partial correlations to examine the association between fitness score at baseline and MetS score at 29-years follow-up, adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic status, smoking status, sleep quality, and physical activity engagement in minutes/ week. RESULTS: A higher fitness score at baseline was significantly associated with a lower MetS score indicative of better metabolic health at 29-years follow-up (r=-0.29; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.011).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility (i) Recruitment capability (ii) Acceptability and Suitability (iii) Demand and Safety of a home-based motor-cognitive eHealth exercise intervention in PD. METHODS: The 10-week intervention was delivered using the ExorLive&#xae; application and exercises were individually adapted and systematically progressed and targeted functional strength, cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, and motor-cognitive function. People with mild-to moderate PD were assessed before and after the intervention regarding; gait performance in single and dual-task conditions; functional mobility; dual-task performance; balance performance; physical activity level; health related quality of life and perceived balance confidence and walking ability; global cognition and executive function. Feasibility outcomes were continuously measured using a home-exercise diary and contact with a physiotherapist. Changes from pre- and post-intervention are reported descriptively. RESULTS: Fifteen participants (mean age 68.5 years) commenced and 14 completed the 10-week intervention. In relation to intervention Acceptability, 64% of the motor sessions and 52% of motor-cognitive sessions were rated as \"enjoyable\". Concerning Suitability, the average level of exertion (Borg RPE scale) was light (11-12). Adherence was high, with 86% of all (420) sessions reported as completed. No falls or other adverse events occurred in conjunction with the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This motor-cognitive eHealth home exercise intervention for PD was safe and feasible in terms of Recruitment capability, Acceptability, Safety and Demand.
